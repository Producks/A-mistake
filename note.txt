6502 notes

Status Register Flags (bit 7 to bit 0)
N	Negative
V	Overflow
-	ignored
B	Break
D	Decimal (use BCD for arithmetics)
I	Interrupt (IRQ disable)
Z	Zero
C	Carry


If the Z flag is 0, then A <> NUM and BNE will branch
If the Z flag is 1, then A = NUM and BEQ will branch
If the C flag is 0, then A (unsigned) < NUM (unsigned) and BCC will branch
If the C flag is 1, then A (unsigned) >= NUM (unsigned) and BCS will branch
